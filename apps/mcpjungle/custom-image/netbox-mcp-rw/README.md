# NetBox MCP Server - Read & Write Edition

**The first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with full read AND write capabilities for NetBox.**

Unlike existing read-only NetBox MCP implementations, this server provides comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling you to not only query your NetBox data but also modify it directly through LLMs that support MCP.

## What Makes This Special

- **First Read-Write NetBox MCP**: The only MCP server that allows both reading from AND writing to NetBox
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete any NetBox object type
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficiently handle multiple objects at once
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports all major NetBox models (DCIM, IPAM, Circuits, Virtualization, etc.)
- **Production Ready**: Built with proper error handling, validation, and security practices

## Features

### Read Operations
- List and filter any NetBox object type
- Get detailed information about specific objects
- Access change history and audit trails
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

### Write Operations
- Create new devices, IP addresses, sites, racks, and more
- Update existing object properties
- Delete objects (with proper safeguards)
- Bulk create, update, and delete operations

### Supported Object Types

**DCIM (Device and Infrastructure):**
- devices, device-types, device-roles, manufacturers
- sites, locations, racks, rack-roles
- cables, interfaces, power-ports, console-ports
- platforms, regions, virtual-chassis

**IPAM (IP Address Management):**
- ip-addresses, prefixes, vlans, vrfs
- asns, aggregates, services
- roles, rirs, route-targets

**Circuits:**
- circuits, circuit-types, providers
- circuit-terminations, provider-networks

**Virtualization:**
- virtual-machines, clusters, cluster-groups
- cluster-types, vm-interfaces

**And many more...**

**Warning**: This server has write capabilities. Always test in a development environment first and ensure your API token has appropriate permissions. Use bulk operations carefully as they can modify many objects at once.
